# Hi there, I'm Nikhil 👋
I’m a Software Engineer at Cisco working on Intersight, where I design and build high-throughput, user-facing distributed systems, focusing on reliability, scalability, and accessibility.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Go, Java, Python, TypeScript  
**Backend:** Microservices, Kafka, gRPC, REST APIs  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, CI/CD  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Lit  
**Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, OpenSearch, Kibana

## ♿ Accessibility & Inclusive Design
I care about building software that is usable by everyone, particularly in complex, enterprise-facing products.
- Designing UIs with accessibility in mind (keyboard navigation, contrast, semantic HTML)
- Writing frontend code that works reliably with screen readers and assistive technologies
- Treating accessibility as a core quality metric alongside performance and reliability
- Believing accessible design leads to simpler, clearer, and more maintainable software
